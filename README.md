# Dazzling Dash!
a terrible top-down racer inspired by Atari Games' Super Sprint.

**To do:**
- [x] get a track.
- [x] get a car.
- [x] get the car moving.
- [x] slow down!
- [x] turn left.
- [x] my bad, it was a right turn.
- [ ] reverse.
- [x] oh no, you went off track. now you're slow :(
- [x] huh, you went off the map. reset.
- [x] get some greenery around the track.
- [ ] alright, now where's the physics?
- [ ] why are we alone? get some computer players atleast.
- [ ] an options menu would be nice.
- [ ] dynamic window resizing.
- [ ] ok that's all i have for now but i'm sure there's more.
